# Hello-World
I need to change myself so that I can adapt to this world better, no matter how hard it would be, 
I have wasted a lot of time, a lot of oppotunity, and sacrifice a lot for nothing.
It would be fair to attribute all my fall to my own fault, bad habits or laziness. 
I think the matter isn't about being tough to myself, it's about change radically, it's about grow up into 
someone else, who is more calm and always know what to do, and most importantly, can carry out every plan he has made.
